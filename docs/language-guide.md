# Rib language guide

Rib is a small expression language for WebAssembly components: WIT-shaped types, [Wasm Wave](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) literals where they apply. Syntax is Rust-like (`let`, blocks, `if` / `then` / `else`, `match`, `instance()` plus dotted export calls)—common in the Wasm toolchain. Grammar stays small: skim the first sections (~5 min), keep the rest for reference.

Repository: [github.com/golemcloud/rib](https://github.com/golemcloud/rib) · Grammar (EBNF): [rib-lang/README.md](../rib-lang/README.md)

### Rib at the REPL (you do not need this whole guide first)

The REPL is the main place Rib is meant to shine. When the host has already loaded your component, the prompt can auto-complete exports and shape arguments for you—almost everything you type is guided from that contract. The experience we aim for: once you are in a wired-up REPL, you should not keep jumping back to WIT source files for ordinary work; the session reflects the types you shipped, and you stay in flow.

Day-to-day use stays small: `instance()`, a `let` binding (e.g. `let my-instance = instance();`), then exports with dot syntax—[§1 *`instance()` and calling exports*](#1-instance-and-calling-exports) is enough to be productive. You are still speaking the component model’s types and Wasm Wave literals, not inventing a parallel schema in your head.

### Rib in scripts and beside APIs (where the language earns its keep)

Rib also shines when you run a program against values that already crossed the boundary: post-process worker or component results, reshape nested `record` / `list` / `option` / `result` trees with `match` and expressions, and test structure and transformations instead of only asserting “something came back.” That is how you avoid hand-written ad-hoc checks that drift from your real WIT. Historically, runtimes such as Golem embedded Rib in API-definition YAML so a small script could reshape the HTTP-facing output of a component-backed worker—same pattern anywhere you want a typed, short script next to config rather than untyped glue.

If your world is WIT, Wasmtime, and components as contracts: Rib is a compact, statically checked expression layer that stays on those types end-to-end—useful whenever you want programmable glue without leaving the WebAssembly component ecosystem.

### About this guide (long on purpose, light in practice)

We document a lot so nothing feels hidden—but Rib is not heavyweight. For REPL work especially, [§1 *`instance()` and calling exports*](#1-instance-and-calling-exports) is usually enough to feel fluent at the prompt, especially with completion wired to your component. Treat the rest of this file as a reference you reach for when you move into scripts, `match` on richer values, resources, comprehensions, or other advanced Rib—not a front-to-back assignment.

If you live around Wasmtime and the component stack: Rib is meant to be a thin layer on the types you already ship—not another big platform to adopt wholesale.

---

This guide lists language features you can use in scripts and in the REPL. It does not focus on embedder-specific globals (e.g. HTTP-shaped `request` inputs): those depend on how `rib-lang` is configured and may change or disappear between releases.

Companion WIT — [`example.wit`](example.wit) exports `inventory` (records, enums, plain funcs) and `shopping` (a `cart` resource) from world `guide-demo`. Start with [§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports); [§0](#0-example-wit-examplewit) spells out the WIT if you want it on the page, and [§9 *`match`*](#9-match-and-patterns) onward when you need more than export calls.

## 0. Example WIT (`example.wit`)

The file [`example.wit`](example.wit) is documentation-only (not wired into the compiler by default), but world `guide-demo` exports two interfaces so the guide can stay in one place:

- `inventory` — records, enums, variants, flags, and plain `func` exports (most examples below).
- `shopping` — a `resource cart` (constructor + methods) used in [§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports) and [§16](#16-wit-resources); its shape is aligned with the shopping-cart style metadata in Rib’s own compiler tests (see [§16](#16-wit-resources) for the path).

| WIT shape | Where | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `record` | `inventory` | `point`, `line-item`, … |
| `enum` | `inventory` | `order-stage`: `draft` \| `placed` \| `shipped` |
| `variant` | `inventory` | `payment-info`, … |
| `flags` | `inventory` | `file-access`: `read`, `write`, `execute` |
| `func` | `inventory` | `length`, `validate-qty`, `lookup-sku`, `ratio`, … |
| `resource` | `shopping` / `cart` | State per cart; `constructor`, `line-count`, `add-line` (uses `inventory`.`line-item`) |

How you call exports from Rib is in [§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports): `let my-instance = instance();` then `my-instance.lookup-sku(...)`, etc. WIT export names use kebab-case after the dot.

---

## 1. `instance()` and calling exports

What `instance()` is (plain version): Your host (REPL, test harness, etc.) has already loaded the Wasm component your WIT describes. `instance()` is the one call that says: “hand me the live object I should send export calls to.” Give that object a `let` name that reads nicely to you—this guide uses `my-instance` because it sits right next to `instance()` and stays easy to spot in snippets. Then call exports with dot syntax, same rhythm as methods on a value in Rust.

```rust
let my-instance = instance();
my-instance.lookup-sku(7)
```

That’s the whole pattern: one binding from `instance()`, then `that-name.export-name(…)`. Export names come from WIT and are usually kebab-case (`lookup-sku`, `format-stage`, …). Hyphens in `let` names are fine too (`store-main`, `lane-a`, …) if you prefer that style.

More calls against [`example.wit`](example.wit) → `inventory`:

```rust
let my-instance = instance();

let d = my-instance.length({ x: 3, y: -4 });
let blurb = my-instance.format-stage(draft);
let label = my-instance.lookup-sku(42); // `option<string>`
let half = my-instance.ratio(9, 2);
let row = my-instance.make-item("pencil", 5u32);
let caps = my-instance.describe-access({ read, write });
```

*For `lookup-sku`, you often follow with `match` on `option`—see [§9.1](#sec-9-1).*

Resources (e.g. `shopping`’s `cart` in the same world) use the same pattern: `let shopping-cart = my-instance.cart("checkout-1");` then `shopping-cart.add-line(…)`. Details in [§16 *WIT resources*](#16-wit-resources).

Exact lowering still depends on your embedder; `example.wit` is the reference. A richer `cart` API in compiler tests is linked from [§16](#16-wit-resources).

---

## 2. Programs, blocks, and semicolons

A Rib **program** is a sequence of expressions separated by **`;`**. The value of the whole program is the **last** expression (REPLs usually print that).

```rust
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
x + y
```

A **block** is `{` … `}` containing its own `;`-separated Rib program:

```rust
let z = {
  let a = 10;
  a + 1
};
z
```

---

## 3. Comments

- **Line:** `//` and `///`  
- **Block:** `/* … */` and doc-style `/** … */`

```rust
// one line

/* block
   comment */
```

---

## 4. Literals and Wave-shaped values

Scalars and structured values use **Wasm Wave** text rules. The right column ties each shape to **[`example.wit`](example.wit)** (`inventory`).

| Kind | Examples | From `inventory` (when relevant) |
|------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Boolean | `true`, `false` | Conditions, e.g. with **`validate-qty`** (`u32` → `bool`) |
| Integer | `0`, `-42`, `42u32` | `qty` is `u32`; point fields are `s32` |
| String | `"hello"` | `sku` values |
| List | `[1, 2, 3]`, `["a"]` | Any `list<…>` you compose at the prompt |
| Record | `{ x: 1, y: -2 }` | A **`point`** literal |
| Record | `{ sku: "pen", qty: 3u32 }` | A **`line-item`** literal |
| Tuple | `("x", 1u32)` | General tuple syntax |
| Flags | `{ read, write }` | A **`file-access`** value (subset of `read`, `write`, `execute`) |
| `option` | `none`, `some("ink")` | Same shape as **`lookup-sku`** result |
| `result` | `ok(7)`, `err("div0")` | Same shape as **`ratio`** result |

---

## 5. Types and annotations

Rib is **statically typed** against the **WIT** you register with the compiler.

**Type ascription** on an expression: **`expr : type`**.

```rust
let n: s32 = 40;
let m: s32 = n + 2;
m
```

Common **scalar** type names: `bool`, `s8`, `u8`, `s16`, `u16`, `s32`, `u32`, `s64`, `u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `char`, `string`.

**Compound** types: `list<string>`, `tuple<s32, string>`, `option<u64>`, `result` / `result<string, string>`, etc.

---

## 6. `let` bindings

```rust
let answer = 42;
let labeled: u64 = 7u64;
```

Bindings from earlier lines **stay in scope** in a REPL session until cleared.

---

## 7. Operators

Binary operators (with usual precedence grouping in Rib): **`+` `-` `*` `/`**, comparisons **`==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`**, and **`&&` `||`**. Unary **`!`**.

**Chaining:** Rib also has suffix forms for indexing, field-like segments, ranges, and further binary ops on the right—see the full grammar in `rib-lang/README.md` for `rib_suffix` / `segment_suffix` / `range_suffix`.

```rust
let xs = [1, 2, 3];
xs[0] == 1
```

---

## 8. `if` / `then` / `else`

```rust
if score > 10u64 then "win" else "lose"
```

All three parts are expressions and must type-check together.

---

## 9. `match` and patterns

`match` chooses an arm by **pattern** on a value. Arms are **`pattern => expr`**, separated by commas, inside `{ }`.  
Below, types come from **[`example.wit`](example.wit)** → **`inventory`**. Rib uses **Wave-shaped** literals and **WIT-derived** constructor / case names (often **kebab-case** where the WIT used hyphens).

<a id="sec-9-1"></a>

### 9.1 `option` — e.g. return type of `lookup-sku`

`lookup-sku` returns `option<string>`. *(`my-instance` here is just an example name—use whatever reads best for you; see [§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports).)*

```rust
let my-instance = instance();
let label = my-instance.lookup-sku(42);

match label {
  some(name) => name,
  none => "unknown"
}
```

<a id="sec-9-2"></a>

### 9.2 `result` — e.g. return type of `ratio`

`ratio` returns `result<s32, string>`.

```rust
let my-instance = instance();
let q = my-instance.ratio(10, 2);

match q {
  ok(n) => n,
  err(msg) => 0
}
```

### 9.3 `enum` — `order-stage` (`draft` \| `placed` \| `shipped`)

Enum patterns are the **case names** from WIT. Suppose **`s`** has type **`order-stage`** (however you obtained it—another function’s return value, etc.):

```rust
match s {
  draft => "still editing",
  placed => "waiting to ship",
  shipped => "on the truck"
}
```

To turn a stage into a single string with a function instead of `match`, call `format-stage` (see [§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports)).

### 9.4 `variant` — `payment-info`

From **`example.wit`**:

```text
variant payment-info { card(string), wallet, failed(string) }
```

Rib patterns use the **case name**; payloads go in parentheses when the case carries data:

```rust
// Suppose `p` has type `payment-info` (e.g. passed in from another call).
match p {
  card(last4) => "card",
  wallet => "wallet",
  failed(reason) => reason
}
```

To produce a single string from a `payment-info` value via an export, use `summarize-payment` on the same `instance()` binding you used elsewhere ([§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports)).

### 9.5 `record` — `point`, `line-item`

Field names match WIT (`x` / `y`, `sku` / `qty`):

```rust
let home = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let item = { sku: "notebook", qty: 2u32 };

match home {
  { x: x, y: y } => x + y
}
```

### 9.6 `list` patterns

```rust
match ids {
  [only] => only,
  _ => 0
}
```

### 9.7 Catch-all and aliases

- **`_`** — any value not covered by earlier arms (required if patterns are not exhaustive).  
- **`name @ pattern`** — bind the **whole** matched value to **`name`** while also matching **`pattern`**.

```rust
match home {
  p @ { x: xa, y: ya } => xa + ya
}
```

---

## 10. More call shapes

[§1](#1-instance-and-calling-exports) already covers `let my-instance = instance();` and dot-syntax export calls (same idea as method calls) such as `my-instance.lookup-sku(42)` and `my-instance.format-stage(draft)` against [`example.wit`](example.wit).

Other shapes you may see:

- Plain function call: `name(arg1, arg2)` for functions registered with the compiler that are not spelled as `receiver.`… exports.
- Qualified WIT paths (package / interface / version / export) when a short name is ambiguous: [§17](#17-qualified-wit-export-paths).
- Resources and `borrow`: construction + methods as in [§16](#16-wit-resources).

Exact export spelling still follows [§0](#0-example-wit-examplewit) and your embedder’s lowering from WIT.

---

## 11. List comprehensions (`for` … `yield`)

```rust
for word in ["hello", "world"] {
  yield word;
}
```

Optional **statements** may appear **before** `yield` in the `{ }` block (same idea as a small inner block).

---

## 12. List aggregation (`reduce` … `yield`)

```rust
reduce acc, x in [1, 2, 3] from 0 {
  yield acc + x;
}
```

Here **`acc`** is the accumulator, **`x`** is each element from the list after **`in`**, and **`from`** supplies the initial accumulator value.

---

## 13. Records, tuples, lists, flags

**Record** — field names and types must match WIT. From **`inventory`**:

```rust
let origin: point = { x: 0, y: 0 };
let row: line-item = { sku: "eraser", qty: 1u32 };
```

**Tuple:** `(a, b, c)` — general syntax; your WIT may or may not expose tuples.

**List:** `[e1, e2, e3]`.

**Flags** — independent booleans from WIT; subset of the declared names. **`file-access`** allows **`read`**, **`write`**, **`execute`**:

```rust
let my-instance = instance();
let f = { read, execute };
my-instance.describe-access(f)
```

---

## 14. `option` and `result`

**Construction** (Wave-shaped; same shapes as **`lookup-sku`** / **`ratio`** results):

```rust
let ok-x = ok(42);
let err-x = err("by-zero");
let some-x = some("found");
let none-x = none;
```

Destruction — see [§9.1](#sec-9-1) (`option`) and [§9.2](#sec-9-2) (`result`) using the real `inventory` return types.

---

## 15. String interpolation

Inside `"…"`, **`${` … `}`** embeds a Rib **block** (sequence of expressions; the block’s value is inserted).

```rust
let name = "Rib";
"The language is ${name}"
```

---

## 16. WIT resources

**[`example.wit`](example.wit)** → interface **`shopping`** defines **`resource cart`**: **`constructor`**, **`line-count`**, **`add-line`**, using **`inventory`.`line-item`**. That is the **small teaching surface** for this repo’s docs.

Rib’s own **shopping-cart style** tests use a larger, programmatic WIT snapshot (interface path **`golem:it/api`**, exports such as **`[constructor]cart`**, **`[method]cart.add-item`**, **`[method]cart.checkout`**, **`[drop]cart`**, …). See **`rib-lang/src/compiler/mod.rs`**, function **`get_metadata`** in the nested **`test_utils`** module (roughly the **`test_invalid_resource_*`** tests and the **`resource_export`** / **`WitExport::Interface`** block that builds the cart API).

A WIT **`resource`** is a **typed object** you obtain from a **constructor** export on whatever **`instance()`** returned—same dot syntax as everything else (e.g. **`let my-instance = instance();`** then **`let shopping-cart = my-instance.cart("checkout-1");`**), then **methods** on **`shopping-cart`** (`add-line`, `line-count`, …, still **kebab-case** from WIT). Under the hood Rib lines this up with WIT’s **`borrow`** rules: the **first** parameter is the resource; Rib fills it in from the left-hand side of the **`.`**.

**Example aligned with `example.wit` / `shopping`:**

```rust
let my-instance = instance();
let shopping-cart = my-instance.cart("checkout-1");
shopping-cart.add-line({ sku: "notebook", qty: 2u32 });
shopping-cart.line-count()
```

**Important**

- **Resource values are not arbitrary Wave text.** Printing or serialising them like ordinary JSON/Wave data is **not** supported the same way as records and numbers; treat them as **opaque** at the boundary unless your embedder defines extra behaviour.
- Some **patterns of nested construction** (e.g. certain inline combinations) may be rejected by the compiler with a specific error—when in doubt, use **`let`** to name intermediate values.
- The **`golem:it/api`** test metadata is **not** the same file as **`example.wit`**; use it when you need a **richer** cart contract while debugging Rib itself.

---

## 17. Qualified WIT export paths

When you need to disambiguate **package / interface / version** and **function**, Rib supports **interface paths** in the grammar, roughly:

`package-namespace:package-name / interface-name @ version . { export }`

Inner **export** forms include plain functions, **`[constructor]`**, **`[method]`**, **`[static]`**, **`[drop]`**, etc., as generated from your WIT. Prefer **`let my-instance = instance();`** then **`my-instance.some-export()`** (kebab-case export names) in REPLs unless you must spell the full path.

## Quick reference card

| Topic | Syntax / reminder |
|-------|-------------------|
| Sequence | `expr1; expr2; expr3` |
| Block | `{ … }` |
| Let | `let x = e` or `let x: T = e` |
| If | `if c then a else b` |
| Match | `match e { pat => x, _ => y }` |
| Call | `f(a, b)` or `recv.method(a)` |
| Instance | `let my-instance = instance();` then `my-instance.lookup-sku(7)` (name is yours) |
| For | `for x in xs { yield y; }` |
| Reduce | `reduce acc, x in xs from init { yield e; }` |
| Option | `none`, `some(x)` |
| Result | `ok(x)`, `err(x)` |
| Interpolate | `"Hello ${ name }"` |
| Resource | constructor + methods on the value; not generic Wave “print me” |

Names in this guide default to **[`example.wit`](example.wit)**. For any other component, substitute the **WIT** you actually loaded — that is what **`rib-lang`** type-checks against.
